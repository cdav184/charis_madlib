Once upon a time in a *pink kingdom far, far away there lived a girl named *Einstein. By the time she reached *65 she was to be married off to the prince in the neighboring kingdom. Rumor had it that he was *ugly and someone who was always *kicked when he eats. I imagine the princess was *soft to be married.
