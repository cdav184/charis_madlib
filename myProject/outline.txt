Once upon a time in an underwater kingdom far, far away there lived a girl named Penelope. By the time she reached 41 she was to be married off to the prince in the neighboring kingdom. Rumor had it that he was really ugly and someone who was always drooling when he eats. I imagine the princess was delighted to be married.
